#### Thank you for using Debug Thugs Application

Since the admin have the option to remove all products from the API we won't leave the login credentials in this ReadMe file.
If you visit our web shop as a customer or just want to try it out, just register a account or use the google login option. No order's will be billed and no product's will be shipped.
##### PLEASE NOTE NO PASSWORD'S THAT YOU USE ARE AVAILABLE FOR US TO SEE

##### Technical notes:
We built an API (see repo https://github.com/roxzlir/ByteBazaarAPI) that is published on azure with it's own database. The API contains all products, categories and images related to products. 
The ByteBazaarWeb is also published on azure with it's oen database to store all the favorite products, carts, order, account's and everything that is need to give you the ultimate shopping experience.
We have used ASP.Core with C# as base, but we have also used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for this build.
